Summary: Raspberry PI Camera video -> opengles texture

This is a hacky example using the Raspberry PI video camera video on a rotating cube.  It merges hello_videocube and hello_video based on work by OtherCrashOverride and HJ Imbens.
I haven't used github before so this might break horribly.  It draws 200 frames and then quits.

Issues:
Frames are not synchronized between capture and display.  Sometimes it looks like the image is updated while the scene is rendering.
The shutdown code works but may not be fully correct.  See the note by ilclient_state_transition(list, OMX_StateLoaded);
